Texturing Readout:
I went throught a few different themes for this map. From WWI to mythology to the current iteration. The maps current name is Temple Grounds. I found a really nice texture pack called Green.Wad that gives a really earthy swamp like theme to it.
I imagine that this map could serve as the ruins of an ancient tample in the deep jungle. A monument to gods that lay forgotten and dormant. I feel like that fits he lovecraft themeing of the core game as well.
